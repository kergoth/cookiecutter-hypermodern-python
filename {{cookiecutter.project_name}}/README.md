The [{{cookiecutter.beets_plugin_name}}](https://github.com/{{cookiecutter.github_user}}/{{cookiecutter.project_name}}) plugin for [beets][] does something useful.

## Installation

As the beets documentation describes in [Other plugins][], to use an external plugin like this one, there are two options for installation:

- Make sure itâ€™s in the Python path (known as `sys.path` to developers). This just means the plugin has to be installed on your system (e.g., with a setup.py script or a command like pip or easy_install). For example, `pip install {{cookiecutter.project_name}}`.
- Set the pluginpath config variable to point to the directory containing the plugin. (See Configuring) This would require cloning or otherwise downloading this [repository](https://github.com/kergoth/beets-stylize) before adding to the pluginpath.

## Configuring

First, enable the `{{cookiecutter.beets_plugin_name}}` plugin (see [Using Plugins][]).

Describe plugin configuration here.

## Using

Describe plugin usage here. Please see the [Command-line Reference] for the command-line interface.
